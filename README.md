# The-Dog-Spot

The Pet Rescuer is a site geared towards helping the user find the perfect dog breed for themselves.

## Description

Our goal is to utilize the knowledge we have gained in Front-End Development to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fully functioning site.  We used this project to incorporate multiple APIs and a separate CSS framework.  Outside of showing our technical skills, we wanted to have fun and build a site where the user can find their perfect breed or just enjoy looking at dog pictures!
